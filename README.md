# Employee-Timestamp-Tracking-System
 I aim to build a system that uses selfies taken by individuals to register their timestamp through the website.

Project Idea
Employee Timestamp Tracking System


On a construction site where the use of technologies for timestamp like ID card scanners are not  always available. I aim to build a system that uses selfies taken by individuals to register their timestamp through the website.  This site will be linked to a database where this timestapes will be recorded. Additionally I will add a calculator to estimate their payment per shifts.
